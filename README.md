Getting and Cleaning Data Course

Project Assignment

run_analysis.R is the code that does the following;
    -Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    -Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    -Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    -Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    -From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

TidyData.txt is the exported TXT file that was created after the steps above.

CodeBook.md is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
